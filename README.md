# Development of cost-effective myoelectric prosthesis

## Overview
This project aims to develop a cost-effective, 3D-printed myoelectric prosthetic hand using biodegradable PLA-based filament. Our solution integrates sustainability and innovation by providing an affordable prosthetic device while reducing plastic waste, making the project eco-friendly and accessible to a wider audience.

## Directory Structure
- [CAD Design](/CAD%20Design/): Contains the STL files for 3D printing the prosthetic hand parts.
- [Microcontroller](/Microcontroller/): Contains the Arduino code for myoelectric integration.
- [Mobile App](/Mobile%20App/): Contains the code for the mobile app.

- [Rehab Module](/Rehab%20Module/): Contains the code for the rehabilitation module.
- [Graph Visualizer](/Graph%20Visualizer/): Contains the code for the graph visualizer.

## Installation & Setup
1. **3D Printing the Parts:**
   - Use the provided STL files in the [CAD Design](/CAD%20Design/) folder for 3D printing the prosthetic hand parts.
   - Load Standard PLA filament into your 3D printer.

2. **Assembling the Prosthetic Hand:**
   - Follow the assembly guide to connect the printed components.

3. **Myoelectric Integration:**
   - Connect the myoelectric sensors to the microcontroller and flash it with the provided code. Find the code in the [Microcontroller Code](/Microcontroller/) folder.
   - Program the hand using [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

## Future Developments
