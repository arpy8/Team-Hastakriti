## Abstract

Electromyography (EMG) is a technique for recording biomedical electrical signals obtained from neuromuscular activities. These signals are used to monitor medical abnormalities and activation levels, and also to analyze the biomechanics of any animal movements. In this article, we provide a short review of EMG signal acquisition and processing techniques. The average efficiency of capture of EMG signals with current technologies is around 70%. Once the signal is captured, signal processing algorithms then determine the recognition accuracy, with which signals are decoded for their corresponding purpose (e.g., moving robotic arm, speech recognition, gait analysis). The recognition accuracy can go as high as 99.8%. The accuracy with which the EMG signal is decoded has already crossed 99%, and with improvements in deep learning technology, there is a large scope for improvement in the design hardware that can efficiently capture EMG signals.

## Introduction

The electrical activities generated by skeletal muscles represent the core EMG signal. EMG is used to read myoelectric signals via electrical measurements. These myoelectric signals are generated from motor neurons which are a part of the central nervous system (CNS). As EMG signals are due to neuromuscular activity, they can be used to diagnose muscle injury, nerve damage, and muscle dysfunction that happens due to neurological and muscular disorder. EMG signals are used to gather simple statistics or can be even used with advanced deep learning to control complex robotic applications.

Furthermore, in some cases, EMG signals can be used for gait analysis and capturing muscle movements. The basic temporal characteristics of the EMG signal include amplitude, phase, rise time, and duration. A satellite is a small signal followed by the main EMG signal.

## Types of Electrodes

There are two major types of electrodes used to measure EMG signals:

1. **Needle Electrodes**:
    - Mono-polar single electrodes
    - Single-fiber EMG electrodes
    - Concentric-EMG electrodes

2. **Surface Electrodes**:
    - Gelled EMG electrodes
    - Dry EMG electrodes

Surface electrodes are non-invasive and work on the principle of chemical equilibrium detecting the change between the muscle surface and body skin through electrolytic conduction.

## Comparison with Other Electrograms

There are three main types of electrograms:
- Electroencephalogram (EEG)
- Electrocardiogram (ECG)
- Electromyogram (EMG)

The advantage of using EMG over ECG and EEG is that ECG and EEG signals are below 100 Hz whereas EMG signals cover the range from 5 Hz to 2 kHz.

## Applications

### Speech Recognition

Many researchers have used EMG for speech recognition. Achieved recognition rates lie between 68 and 97% with an average success rate of 85.4%. Recently, innovative methods of speech recognition using EMG signals from the face have achieved 92.1% accuracy.

### Robotic Applications

EMG signals are often used as input in a lot of robotic applications. For example, a portable EMG circuit for a prosthetic arm has achieved high fidelity and excellent signal to noise ratio.

### Diagnostic Applications

Different techniques for EMG signal processing have been used for the functional evaluation of patients with conditions like spastic diplegia. EMG signals have also been used to analyze finger movements and classify them into different types.

## EMG Signal Acquisition and Processing

A low-cost EMG system for the acquisition of Arm Activities Recognition (AAR) found that about 80% of the EMG signals were captured efficiently with an overall accuracy for AAR of about 79%. Various obstacles like noise can interrupt EMG signal acquisition, and methods for their detection and classification have been developed.

## Analysis and Discussion

For the purposes of this review, the capture efficiency, error rate, classification accuracy, type of electrode, and recognition accuracy of multiple published papers were recorded. Recognition accuracy ranges from 68 to 99.8%, with the majority of recorded literature showing more than 90% accuracy. However, the capture efficiency for EMG signals is considerably lower, lying in the range of 50 to 80%. Hence, there is a large scope for improvement in designing proper EMG signal acquisition hardware with minimal noise.

## Conclusion

EMG signal acquisition and processing have vast applications in medical diagnostics, speech recognition, and robotic control. While recognition accuracy has reached impressive levels, there is still significant room for improvement in capture efficiency. Future advancements in deep learning and hardware design are expected to enhance the effectiveness of EMG signal acquisition and processing.
